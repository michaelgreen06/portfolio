My Skills
I am transitioning careers and need help creating a unified narrative that showcases all of my unique skills to help me stand out as someone companies would love to hire/work with. I want to sell myself as someone who can help solve big problems using digital tools to build world class digital products (websites, apps, automations etc)

I am transitioning from physical products to digital products. I have limited experience building digital products but am constantly building digital products as often as possible now and am using all the newly available cutting edge tools to help me create meaningful products w/ minimal effort. I can now create things that only senior engineers would previously be able to create. My ever increasing knowledge of software development helps me build things more effectively than the average "vibe coder" because I understand foundationally what is happening so I can address issues when they arise instead of relying on the tools to solve all the problems which currently doesn't work very well. 

I am going to use this narrative to update my online presence primarily on my portfolio website.

Here are a few things that help me stand out: 
- I am good at 0 to 1 product building and have a track record of building successful physical products
- I am VERY detail oriented. Sometimes maybe too much so. 
- I have structured my life in a way that increases my attention span and my ability to focus deeply in a world of endless distractions and shortening attention spans
- I have always been very technically capable and I am able to learn new things quickly and easily.
- I follow the lean startup methodology of build measure learn. 
-  have good ideas of products to build that solve my own problems and focus on problems that other people have so the products are in demand. 
- i am very efficient and focus on the most effective tasks constantly utilizing the 80/20 principle to decide what i should focus on while also getting frequent feedback to determine if I am actually focusing on the right things (build measure learn)
- I am very focused on using technology as a force for good and creating things that benefit humnas through technology rather than extracting from them like many current technologies like social media do. 

q&a
b) How do you feel about featuring your cannabis-dispenser product in your portfolio? Some companies might not mind, but others might—so do you want to spotlight it (because it strongly illustrates your 0→1 skill) or briefly mention it only?
b i am happy to talk about my cannabis product as it's unavoidable since it's the thing I've been doing for over 9 years

c) Are you open to working with companies specifically focused on sustainability or environmental impact, or are you aiming for a more general audience but including your sustainability mindset as a value-add?
c i am targeting a general audience in the tech industry. They don't need to be focused on sustainability or environmental impact at all.

d) What kind of roles or projects are you most interested in attracting—full-stack software, product development, operations, or a blend?
d any and all of these

I graduated from college in 2011 w/ a degree in chemical engineering w/ an emphasis in sustainable energy engineering. I had to take a few courses related to sustainability and they have really impacted the way I think about things /view the world. I am always thinking about the environmental impact of my decisions (often to a fault :laughing_emoji). 

I worked in a cannabis dispensary from 2011 to 2016 doing operations and helped them scale medical only sales to recreational sales which was a 3-5x increase in business. I also initiated many projects w/ an emphasis on environmental sustainability. In 2015 the dispensary wanted to make joints that were smaller than what was currently being offered on the market. At the time all stores will selling 1g joints but they wanted to sell 0.25g joints. There was no tool available for efficiently making joints that were 0.25g joints so I created one for them. The smaller joints were massively successful for them and so I quit working for them to sell that product to other dispensaries so they could also make small joints and successfully sell them. I quickly leared that convincing dispensaries they should sell smaller joints was much harder than I originally realized. After about 1 yr trying to sell b2b I pivoted and staretd selling b2c and that is when things really took off for me. I’ve been successfully selling the main product packNpuff on amazon since 2017. It now has 4.6 stars and over 930 reviews. It has been knocked off by competitors and sales have been up and down since more competing products started popping up in 2021. I make a big effort to ensure I do everything in an environmentally sustainable way as possible. The packNpuff is 3d printed using plant based plastic. I don’t use any single use plastic anywhere. The packaging is made from recycled material. I was the only person running the company until April 2023 when I convinced my parents to take over production and packaging and fulfilment. This has enabled me to leave the us for the winter so I can spend that time in SE Asia. I have created other innovative products for this project which showcase that ability to understand users needs. 

I have been working on software products for the last few years. I have taken a coding bootcamp online in 2021 then re-did it in 2024. I have made a few projects for hackathons. I worked for an organization doing operations then briefly did some software development for them. 
I just recently completed a project called wetbulb35.com which shows the wetbulb temperature for any location on earth. I’ve contributed to the following projects recently:
Cookie jar (decentralized petty cash drawer for web3 orgs), trin etheruem clidnt desktop ui, eliza os ai agent framework and a few others

I also started a coworking space with some friends last summer (regenhub.xyz). It is unique because we don't have any staff, we are the staff. we run it as a self operating system which is very uncommon in the world of coworking spaces. 

I have been into personal development/self growth since I started college. I was introduced to the GTD method in 2008 and have been implementing it in various ways ever since. It keeps me very organized and helps me be efficient. I am currently very obsessed w/ the idea of deep work taught by cal Newport in his book deep work and have been practicing to deepen my focus and live in a state of focus and take breaks for distraction instead of the other way around since 2019. I loved greg mcewens book essentialism and try to ruthlessly focus on what is essential and constantly apply the 80/20 analysis so I am working on the things that are the most important so I can be as effective as possible. Everyone who knows me tells me I am one of the most disciplined people they know. I have a very structured and organized life w/ very solid routines. I go to bed at 9pm wake up at 5am meditate for 30 min then exercise for 60 then I shower eat and get to work early. I have all of my notifications off so that I am not distracted. I don’t use social media. I usually am able to avoid checking my phone throughout the day. When I work I focus on one thing and focus on it for 2-3 hrs and don’t do anything distracting like checking emails / messages etc.


I know I would be an amazing asset to any team but I just don’t know how to sell myself / tell my story in a way that conveys all the value I can provide. Please help me figure out how to highlight my unique skillset so I can portray that online through my portfolio website. 

Please help me tell my story in a way that can portray my skills and all the value I can add to a company or a client. Please ask any clarifying questions as needed. 

I've been in the blockchain space since 2017 and have contributed to reputable projects in the space like gitcoin (2021-2023)

I want to portray myself as a general builder who can easily use available technologies to solve a wide range of problems
I don't want to be to focuse on sustainability as it's a bit of a polarizing topic these days. 

 I  want you to help me w/ specific things like distilling this all down into a single sentence that I can use on the top of my website and linked in profile. I also want you to craft a full narrative for my about me page on my portfolio site. I also want a 2-3 sentence about me summary to put at the bottom page of my portfolio site landing page. Please write all of these for me. please also write a cta for the get in touch section at the bottom of the landing page of my portfolio site. I also want you to create a single sentence for the footer of the whole portfolio site.
