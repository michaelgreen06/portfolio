#Full Stack Developer & Product Builder


I'm a Full Stack Developer driven by the challenge of transforming complex problems into effective digital solutions. My journey began in Chemical Engineering and led me to successfully build and scale a physical product business from the ground up (0-to-1). Now, I apply that same entrepreneurial grit, analytical mindset, and a deliberately cultivated deep focus to building robust, user-centric websites, applications, and automations with modern technologies.

##From Physical Products to Digital Solutions

My transition into software development is built on a proven foundation of real-world product creation. I founded Simpacti, the company behind packNpuff, over nine years ago and have been running it ever since. PackNpuff is a product I designed to address a specific need in the cannabis accessory market. This venture has been a comprehensive lesson in the entire product lifecycle: identifying a user pain point (inefficiently making smaller joints), engineering a novel solution, navigating manufacturing, adapting my strategy from B2B to a successful B2C model on Amazon (achieving 4.5 stars with 930+ reviews), and managing all aspects of the business. I learned firsthand the importance of user empathy, iterative development based on feedback (Build-Measure-Learn), resilience in overcoming obstacles, and operational efficiency – even incorporating sustainable practices like plant-based materials and recycled packaging. 

##My Engineering & Technical Approach

My Chemical Engineering background provides a strong foundation in analytical thinking, problem-solving, and understanding systems – principles I now apply to software architecture and development. Recognizing the power of digital tools, I've immersed myself in modern web technologies through intensive bootcamps and continuous self-study, rapidly acquiring proficiency in frameworks like React, Next.js, Node.js, and database management with PostgreSQL.

Crucially, my engineering mindset drives me to understand the fundamentals behind the tools I use. This allows me to move beyond surface-level implementation, troubleshoot effectively when challenges arise, and build more resilient and scalable solutions. I actively leverage cutting-edge tools, including AI assistants, to enhance my workflow and build sophisticated features efficiently. My approach is grounded in lean principles: identifying the core problem, building iteratively, measuring results, and focusing relentlessly on delivering value (applying the 80/20 principle).

##Focus & Efficiency: My Way of Working

In a world of constant distraction, I've intentionally cultivated the ability to focus deeply and work efficiently. Inspired by concepts from Deep Work, Essentialism, and Getting Things Done, I structure my days for sustained concentration, minimize distractions and dedicate focused blocks of time to complex tasks. This discipline isn't just a personal habit; it's a professional asset that enables me to learn quickly, produce high-quality results, solve difficult problems, and reliably deliver results for any team I join.
