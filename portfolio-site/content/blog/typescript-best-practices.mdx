# TypeScript Best Practices I've Learned the Hard Way

After several years of working with TypeScript across multiple projects, I've accumulated a set of practices that have significantly improved my code quality and development experience. These aren't necessarily obvious from the TypeScript documentation, but rather lessons learned through trial, error, and sometimes painful debugging sessions.

## Type Everything (Almost)

When I first started with TypeScript, I was inconsistent with type annotations. Sometimes I'd rely on inference, other times I'd explicitly type everything. Over time, I've settled on a more balanced approach:

### Do Type:

- Function parameters and return types
- Complex object structures
- State in React components
- API responses and requests

```typescript
// Good: Explicit typing for function parameters and return
function calculateTotal(items: CartItem[], discount?: Discount): number {
  // Implementation
}
