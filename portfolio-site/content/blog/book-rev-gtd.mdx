# Getting Things Done: How It Shapes My Approach to Organized Development

## Why Organization Matters & Why This Book

In software development, the sheer volume of inputs can be overwhelming: feature requests, bug reports, documentation needs, learning tasks, and countless other commitments compete for attention. Without a reliable system to manage this complexity, critical tasks slip through the cracks, context switching becomes overwhelming, and cognitive load skyrockets.

I first encountered David Allen's "Getting Things Done" (GTD) back in August 2008, before my transition to software development. As a undergrad chemcical engineering student facing multi-faceted challenges, I needed a system that could help me manage diverse responsibilities without letting important details slip. Allen's methodology promised exactly that: a comprehensive approach to capturing, clarifying, organizing, and executing on commitments. Fifteen years later, the principles from this book continue to form the backbone of how I manage my professional responsibilities.

## Key Insights That Resonated

### Insight 1: Externalizing the Mental Workload

At its core, GTD operates on a simple premise: your mind is for having ideas, not holding them. Allen argues that trying to keep track of commitments in your head creates what he calls "open loops"—unresolved tensions that consume mental energy and create background stress.

This concept was revolutionary for me. As an engineer and developer, I'm constantly juggling multiple complex problems. By creating trusted external systems to capture and organize these commitments, I've freed up tremendous mental bandwidth for creative problem-solving and deep technical work.

### Insight 2: The Capture-Process-Organize Workflow

Allen's systematic approach to information processing—capturing everything in collection buckets, processing items one by one, and organizing them into appropriate categories (next actions, projects, reference material, etc.)—provides a clear framework for handling the constant influx of information in technical work.

The discipline of regularly processing these inputs and making clear decisions about their nature has been invaluable in my development work. It transforms vague anxieties ("I should look into that API issue sometime") into concrete, actionable tasks that can be systematically addressed.

### Insight 3: The Weekly Review Process

Perhaps the most valuable insight from GTD is the importance of the weekly review—a dedicated time to process inboxes, update projects, review upcoming actions, and maintain the system. Allen calls this "getting clear, current, and creative."

This regular maintenance prevents the system from degrading and ensures nothing important is overlooked. As a developer managing multiple projects simultaneously, this practice has been essential for maintaining both control and perspective.

## Putting Theory into Practice: Real-World Application

### Application: Structured Project Management for Software Development

I've adapted GTD principles specifically for software development by creating a project management approach that:

- Maintains separate "collection buckets" for different inputs (GitHub issues, personal code improvements, learning resources)
- Defines clear "next actions" for each project that specify the exact next step
- Organizes reference materials (documentation, code snippets, learning resources) in an easy to access system

When developing Wetbulb35.com, this system allowed me to seamlessly manage both technical implementation details and high-level architecture decisions. By having clear next actions defined (e.g., "Implement geolocation API fallback" rather than the vague "Fix location issues"), I could move efficiently between tasks without losing momentum. The result was a more methodical development process with fewer overlooked details.

### Application: Weekly Review Ritual for Technical Work

Every Friday afternoon, I conduct a comprehensive review process adapted from GTD that includes:

- Processing all collection points (email, task manager, GitHub notifications, notes)
- Reviewing active codebase issues and identifying any undefined next steps
- Evaluating upcoming deadlines and adjusting priorities
- Checking my "waiting for" list to follow up on blocked items
- Planning the following week's key development priorities

This ritual has been transformative for maintaining momentum across complex projects. While developing contributions to open-source projects like Trin Ethereum Client UI, this process ensured I never dropped threads or lost sight of important issues, making me a more reliable contributor.

## Further Thoughts & Considerations

While GTD has been tremendously valuable, I've found that some principles require adaptation for modern development work. The "two-minute rule" (immediately handling any task that takes less than two minutes), for instance, can be counterproductive during deep work sessions focused on complex programming problems. I've modified this by batching quick tasks for designated "shallow work" periods to protect focused coding time.

Additionally, I've found that GTD pairs powerfully with Cal Newport's "Deep Work" philosophy—GTD provides the organizational infrastructure that enables focused cognitive effort by ensuring nothing important is forgotten and all commitments are tracked.

## Conclusion: The Takeaway for My Work

After 15+ years of applying and refining GTD principles, the most significant impact has been the peace of mind that comes from having a trusted system. This isn't just about feeling organized—it directly translates to tangible professional advantages:

- Greater reliability: Teammates and stakeholders know that when I commit to something, it will get done
- Reduced stress: Clear systems mean less energy spent worrying about forgotten commitments
- Improved prioritization: A comprehensive view of all commitments enables better resource allocation
- Enhanced creativity: With basic organization handled by my system, my mind is free to focus on solving complex technical problems

For development teams seeking members who can manage complexity without dropping balls, the organizational discipline that GTD has helped me cultivate represents a genuine competitive advantage. In an industry where details matter enormously and reliability is prized, having a trusted system for managing commitments isn't just about productivity—it's about professionalism.
