## Introduction (The Hook & Overview)
*   Hook the reader (What's the problem/context?)
*   Briefly introduce the project/topic.
*   What key things will this post cover? (e.g., tech stack highlights, specific challenges, learnings)
*   *(Optional: Link to live project/repo early)*

## The Problem / Project Goal / Motivation
*   Why did you undertake this project or explore this topic?
*   What specific problem were you trying to solve or what skill were you aiming to learn/demonstrate?
*   *(Your "Project Motivation & Objectives" section fits perfectly here)*

## The Approach: Key Decisions & Architecture
*   High-level overview of the tech stack and *why* you chose it.
*   Key architectural decisions (e.g., routing, state management, data flow).
*   Explain the reasoning behind these choices â€“ trade-offs considered.
*   *(Combine parts of your "App Structure & Implementation")*

## Deep Dive: Implementation Highlights [Optional: Choose 1-3 Key Areas]
*   *(Use H3 headings for specific features/areas)*
    *   **Example H3: Tackling [Specific Challenge like Data Processing]**
        *   Detailed explanation of the implementation.
        *   Include relevant, explained code snippets.
        *   *Explicitly mention skills demonstrated.*
