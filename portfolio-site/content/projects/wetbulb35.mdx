# WetBulb35: Climate Safety App

## Project Overview

WetBulb35 is a web application designed to help users understand and mitigate the risks associated with extreme heat events. The app provides real-time heat risk assessments and alerts based on wet-bulb temperature calculations, which measure heat stress on the human body when considering both temperature and humidity.

## The Problem

Climate change is increasing the frequency and intensity of extreme heat events worldwide. Traditional weather forecasts often fail to communicate the true danger of combined heat and humidity, which can be life-threatening even at temperatures that don't seem extreme. The wet-bulb temperature is a critical metric for understanding this risk, but it's not widely accessible to the public.

## The Solution

WetBulb35 addresses this gap by:

1. **Calculating wet-bulb temperatures** from standard weather data
2. **Visualizing heat risk** on interactive maps
3. **Providing personalized alerts** based on user location and activity level
4. **Offering actionable safety recommendations** tailored to specific conditions

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend Development

The application is built with Next.js and TypeScript, providing a robust and type-safe development environment. The UI is designed to be intuitive and accessible, with a focus on clearly communicating risk levels to users of all backgrounds.

### Data Visualization

Using D3.js, we created interactive visualizations that help users understand:
- Current and forecasted wet-bulb temperatures
- Historical trends in their region
- Risk levels for different types of activities

### API Integration

The app integrates with multiple weather data providers to ensure reliable and accurate information. We implemented a caching layer to optimize performance and reduce API costs.

## Challenges and Solutions

### Data Accuracy

**Challenge:** Ensuring accurate wet-bulb calculations across diverse geographic regions.

**Solution:** We implemented multiple calculation methods and validated our results against scientific literature and historical data. We also incorporated uncertainty indicators where appropriate.

### User Comprehension

**Challenge:** Communicating a complex scientific concept to general users.

**Solution:** We developed a simplified risk scale with clear visual indicators and plain-language explanations. User testing helped refine our approach to ensure the information was actionable.

## Outcomes and Impact

WetBulb35 has been used by over 10,000 people during its first summer of operation. Key impacts include:

- **Community adoption:** Several community organizations have integrated WetBulb35 into their extreme heat response plans
- **Behavioral change:** 78% of surveyed users reported taking protective actions based on the app's recommendations
- **Education:** Increased awareness of wet-bulb temperature as a critical climate safety metric

## Future Development

We're currently working on several enhancements:

1. **Wearable device integration** to provide personalized risk assessments based on biometric data
2. **Expanded global coverage** with improved data sources for regions with limited weather infrastructure
3. **Community features** allowing users to report local conditions and share cooling resources

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Data Visualization:** D3.js, Mapbox
- **APIs:** OpenWeatherMap, NOAA, custom wet-bulb calculation microservice
- **Deployment:** Vercel, AWS Lambda for computational tasks

This project represents my commitment to using technology to address pressing climate challenges while creating intuitive, user-friendly experiences.
