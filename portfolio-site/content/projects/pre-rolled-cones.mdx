# Pre-Rolled Cones: Engineering Supply Chain Independence

## Project Overview

The Pre-Rolled Cones project represents my strategic transition from relying on third-party suppliers to developing custom-designed, branded cones specifically engineered to work perfectly with the packNpuff loader. These organic hemp cones were created with precisely calculated dimensions to optimize functionality while simplifying customer choice through a streamlined product lineup.

## The Problem

As the packNpuff gained market traction, several critical supply chain vulnerabilities emerged:

1. **Supply uncertainty:** Dependency on a single well-known brand led to frequent stockouts
2. **Production bottlenecks:** Inability to fulfill packNpuff orders when cone supplies were depleted
3. **Lack of control:** No influence over quality, dimensions, or materials used in third-party cones
4. **Business continuity risk:** Supply shortages directly impacted revenue potential
5. **Brand inconsistency:** Multiple component brands created a fragmented customer experience

These issues became increasingly problematic as sales volume grew, threatening the sustainability of the business model and limiting growth potential.

## The Solution

I developed a comprehensive strategy to address these challenges:

1. **Custom manufacturing partnership:** Established direct relationships with overseas manufacturers
2. **Technical standardization:** Engineered consistent aspect ratios across different cone sizes
3. **Material specification:** Standardized on organic hemp paper for sustainability and quality
4. **Product simplification:** Offered only two sizes (renamed "standard" and "large" for clarity)
5. **Ethical manufacturing verification:** Personal factory visit to confirm labor practices
6. **Perfect compatibility:** Custom dimensions designed specifically for packNpuff v2

This approach resulted in cones with precise specifications that perfectly complement the packNpuff loader while establishing complete control over a critical supply chain component.

## Technical Implementation

### Engineering Challenge

The most significant technical challenge involved standardizing the aspect ratio between different cone sizes. Traditionally, standard (1Â¼) and large size cones have different proportions, which would require separate internal dimensions within the packNpuff.

I solved this by redesigning the standard size cone to match the aspect ratio of large size cones:
- **Standardized geometry:** Both sizes now share the same proportional relationship between top diameter, bottom diameter, and height
- **Dimensional precision:** Standard cones maintained at 84mm height versus 109mm for large cones
- **Universal compatibility:** packNpuff v2 designed around a single aspect ratio that works with both proprietary and major third-party cones

### Manufacturing Partnership

After extensive research and multiple supplier iterations, I established a relationship with a leading Indonesian manufacturer who:
- Offers organic hemp paper options
- Maintains consistent quality control standards
- Provides custom design capabilities
- Operates with ethical labor practices

A personal visit to their Bali facility in 2023 confirmed they maintain excellent working conditions and prioritize female employment, making them one of the island's largest private employers.

## Challenges and Solutions

### Supplier Identification

**Challenge:** Finding a direct manufacturer willing to produce custom dimensions in sustainable materials proved extremely difficult, with many intermediaries obscuring direct factory access.

**Solution:** Persistent research eventually led to a manufacturer who not only met all requirements but proved to be one of the industry's major suppliers, including to the original brand I had relied upon.

### Packaging Logistics

**Challenge:** Initially, I ordered bulk unpackaged cones and worked with an ethical repackaging service in the US that employed marginalized workers, creating significant logistical complexity.

**Solution:** While this arrangement supported an important social mission, it proved unsustainable from a business perspective. Future orders will include manufacturer packaging to improve scalability.

### Customer Acceptance

**Challenge:** Some customers expressed loyalty to established cone brands despite functional equivalence.

**Solution:** Emphasized the perfect compatibility with packNpuff and consistent availability as key selling points, while maintaining functional compatibility with third-party cones for customer flexibility.

## Outcomes and Impact

The transition to custom pre-rolled cones has delivered significant business benefits:

- **Supply chain control:** Eliminated stockouts and production delays
- **Brand consistency:** Complete product ecosystem under one brand
- **Product messaging:** Ability to market "perfectly designed" compatibility
- **Business sustainability:** Addition of a consumable product line with repeat purchase potential
- **Simplified customer experience:** Reduced decision paralysis through limited, clear options
- **Ethical sourcing:** Confidence in manufacturing conditions after personal verification

## Future Development

The roadmap for pre-rolled cones includes:

1. **Streamlined packaging:** Transitioning packaging to the manufacturing source
2. **Inventory optimization:** Improving forecasting to maintain ideal stock levels
3. **Potential new materials:** Exploring additional sustainable paper options
4. **Maintaining size simplicity:** Continuing to focus on just two sizes with clear naming conventions

## Technologies Used

- **Materials:** Organic hemp paper
- **Design:** Custom aspect ratio calculations for dimensional consistency
- **Manufacturing:** Direct partnership with international production facility
- **Supply Chain:** Strategic transition from dependency to ownership

This project demonstrates how vertical integration through custom component design can address critical business vulnerabilities while simultaneously improving product functionality and customer experience.
