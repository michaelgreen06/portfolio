# Cone Holders + Filters: Sustainable Smoking Accessories

## Project Overview

Cone Holders + Filters is an innovative, dual-purpose solution addressing both hygiene concerns and filtration needs for pre-rolled cone users. Designed during the COVID-19 pandemic, this product enables safer sharing by eliminating direct contact with the cone while simultaneously providing effective smoke filtration through biodegradable plant cellulose filtersâ€”a combination not previously available in the market.

## The Problem

My product development process identified multiple unaddressed needs in the pre-rolled cone market:

1. **Hygiene concerns:** The pandemic highlighted the risks of germ transmission when sharing pre-rolled cones among friends
2. **Lack of filtration:** Unlike cigarettes, which are typically filtered, 99% of pre-rolled cones offer no smoke filtration
3. **Environmental impact:** The few filters available in the market are primarily made from acetate tow (essentially plastic)
4. **Health considerations:** Health-conscious cannabis users had no practical option for filtered pre-rolled cones
5. **Design limitations:** The conical shape of pre-rolled cones created a technical challenge for implementing effective filters

## The Solution

The Cone Holders + Filters system addresses these challenges through an integrated approach:

1. **Hygienic sharing:** Each person uses their own holder, which interfaces with the cone without direct lip contact
2. **Effective filtration:** Specially sourced biodegradable plant cellulose filters fit precisely in the holders
3. **Sustainable materials:** Both holders and filters use plant-based, biodegradable materials
4. **Safety design:** An engineered inner lip prevents the filter from being accidentally inhaled
5. **Versatile compatibility:** Precisely calculated dimensions work with both standard pre-rolled cones and 6mm filters

The visible change in filter color from white to black after just a few uses provides a tangible demonstration of the filtration effectiveness, while users report minimal impact on the desired effects of the plant material.

## Technical Implementation

### Sustainable Manufacturing

The cone holders are 3D printed using the same plant-based PLA plastic and manufacturing process as my packNpuff product. This approach enables:

- **Resource efficiency:** Utilizing excess filament when spools contain insufficient material for larger products
- **Consistent quality:** Leveraging existing manufacturing expertise and equipment
- **Zero waste production:** On-demand printing minimizes excess inventory

### Precision Engineering

The holders required precise engineering to balance multiple requirements:

- **Exact diameter calculations** to accommodate both standard pre-rolled cones and 6mm filters
- **Inner lip design** that prevents filters from being accidentally inhaled
- **Tolerance adjustments** to account for slight variations in filter sizes while maintaining functionality

### Sustainable Filtration

The biodegradable plant cellulose filters provide:

- **Effective smoke filtration** without significantly reducing desired effects
- **Environmentally responsible alternative** to plastic-based filters
- **Visual feedback** on filtration effectiveness as the filter changes color

## Challenges and Solutions

### Supply Chain Complexities

**Challenge:** Sourcing consistent biodegradable filters has proven difficult due to federal regulations and minimum order quantity requirements that exceed current sales volume.

**Solution:** I continue to research and establish relationships with potential suppliers while maintaining strict standards for biodegradability and performance.

### Technical Design Balance

**Challenge:** Filters have slight variations in size, while pre-rolled cones require specific dimensions for proper fit.

**Solution:** Through extensive prototyping, I developed a holder diameter that accommodates these variations while maintaining functionality for both components.

### Sustainable Packaging

**Challenge:** Finding suppliers who can package filters in sustainable materials without single-use plastics.

**Solution:** This remains an ongoing challenge that will be addressed as part of the scaling strategy, potentially through partnerships with specialized sustainable packaging providers.

## Future Development

The roadmap for Cone Holders + Filters includes:

1. **Material evolution** to metal tubing for increased durability and customization potential
2. **Brand customization options** to enable wholesale opportunities with dispensary brands
3. **Supply chain development** to secure consistent sources of biodegradable filters
4. **Packaging improvements** to ensure the entire product ecosystem maintains zero single-use plastics
5. **Education campaign** about the benefits of filtered pre-rolled cones for health-conscious consumers

## Technologies Used

- **Manufacturing:** FFF 3D Printing
- **Materials:** Plant-based PLA plastic for holders
- **Filtration:** Biodegradable plant cellulose filters
- **Packaging:** Focus on recycled materials and zero single-use plastics

This project demonstrates how pandemic-driven innovation can create sustainable solutions that address multiple consumer needs simultaneously. By combining hygiene concerns with environmental considerations and health benefits, Cone Holders + Filters represents a holistic approach to product development with long-term value beyond the initial pandemic use case.
